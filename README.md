Andrew Morris
My name is Andrew Morris, I am 22 years old and I hail from Fort Collins, Colorado. I have two sister one older and one younger. My family owns one dog named Ella and many chickens. I enjoy reading, playing games, and hanging out with my friends. I am currently majoring in software engineering and as of now this is my second year at BYU Idaho. I am excited to take this class and hope to learn new ways of programming and learn how to work in a team better.
